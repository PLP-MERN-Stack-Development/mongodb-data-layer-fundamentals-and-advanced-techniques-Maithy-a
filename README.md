# üìö PLP Bookstore ‚Äì MongoDB Data Layer Fundamentals

This project demonstrates the fundamentals of MongoDB, including setup, CRUD operations, advanced queries, aggregation pipelines, and indexing.  
It was built as part of **PLP Week 1 : MongoDB ‚Äì Data Layer Fundamentals and Advanced Techniques**.

## üöÄ Features Implemented

‚úÖ MongoDB setup with database **`plp_bookstore`** and collection **`books`**  
‚úÖ Inserted sample data (`insert_books.js`) with 10+ book documents  
‚úÖ Basic CRUD operations (find, update, delete)  
‚úÖ Advanced queries: filtering, projection, sorting, pagination  
‚úÖ Aggregation pipelines for data analysis  
‚úÖ Indexing for performance optimization

## Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/PLP-MERN-Stack-Development/mongodb-data-layer-fundamentals-and-advanced-techniques-Maithy-a.git
    cd mongodb-data-layer-fundamentals-and-advanced-techniques-Maithy-a
   ```

2. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   Make sure you have dotenv installed:
   ```bash
   npm install dotenv
   ```
3. Configure Environment Variables
   Create a `.env` file in the project root:

   ```bash
   MONGO_URI=your_atlas_url
   ```

4. Insert Sample Data
   Run the script to populate the books collection:
   ```bash
   node insert_books.js
   ```

## Usage

To run queries, open `queries.js` and execute with Node.js:

```bash
node queries.js
```

Alternatively, copy queries into MongoDB Shell (mongosh) or MongoDB Compass to execute manually.

## ‚ö° Technologies Used
